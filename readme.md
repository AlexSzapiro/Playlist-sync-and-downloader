# 🎵 FUVI Playlist Automator & Track Sync Tools

This project automates music playlist synchronization and downloading with two core scripts:

1. `list_missing_tracks.py` — Analyze which Spotify tracks are missing from your local collection.
2. `fuvi_download.py` — Log into [music.fuvi-clan.com](https://music.fuvi-clan.com), search for tracks, and auto-add matches to a specific playlist.

## 🔍 Script 1: list_missing_tracks.py
### ✅ Purpose

Detect which tracks from a Spotify playlist are missing from your local DJ library.

### ▶️ Run

Remember to make the playlist public before running.

```bash
python list_missing_tracks.py "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/..."
  --folder_path "/path/to/your/music/folder"
```

### 📤 Outputs
matched_tracks.txt: Tracks found in both Spotify and your local library

missing_tracks.txt: Tracks in Spotify but not in local files (used by fuvi_download.py)

unmatched_local.txt: Local files that didn’t match anything from Spotify

---

## 🎧 Script 2: fuvi_download.py
### ✅ Purpose
Use Selenium to:

Log into music.fuvi-clan.com

Verify or create the playlist

Search and fuzzy-match tracks

Add best match to playlist

### ▶️ Run

```bash
python fuvi_download.py
```

Make sure missing_tracks.txt exists (output from list_missing_tracks.py).

### 📤 Outputs
added_tracks.txt: Tracks successfully added to the FUVI playlist

not_found_tracks.txt: Tracks not found or not confidently matched

### 🧪 Matching Logic
Uses fuzzy logic on Artist - Title (with normalization)

Permutates artist combinations (e.g., "A, B" vs "B, A")

Skips results under 92% similarity threshold

### 🛠 Debugging Tips
If FUVI login fails: check fuvi_login_debug.html

If search fails: check debug_visible_results.html

If playlist modal fails: check debug_modal.html (optional if implemented)

Ensure playlist "Z" exists or edit the script to change name

### 📌 Notes
FUVI modal interaction is automated (no manual steps needed).

Spotify comparison supports multiple audio extensions: .mp3, .wav, .flac, etc.

You can rerun the process repeatedly with updated missing_tracks.txt.
